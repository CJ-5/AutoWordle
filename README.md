# WordleAuto
A tool for wordle that suggests words based off of inputted data. This is not perfect, its base framework was created in 2 hours.
A future version will add the feature for worlde to be done automatically (For those who are into that kind of thing).

### Packages:
- colorama
- pynput

### Usage:
1. Load a file from the main command menu via the 'load' command. Select a word list that contains all words under the "word_list" key
2. Select any other command (analyze will analyze all words in the list and suggest a word best suited to be the starter word. Complete, not implemented (functionality mentioned before, auto completion), and suggest which is the main command that you will use)
use 'suggest' and then help to see its usage. Then select one of the unused words from its list of candidates and rinse and repeat.

simple.
Enjoy!
